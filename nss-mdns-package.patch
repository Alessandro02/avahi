 .SH DESCRIPTION
-The Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon implements Apple's Zeroconf architecture (also known as "Rendezvous" or "Bonjour"). The daemon registers local IP addresses and static services using mDNS/DNS-SD and provides two IPC APIs for local programs to make use of the mDNS record cache the avahi-daemon maintains. First there is the so called "simple protocol" which is used exclusively by avahi-dnsconfd (a daemon which configures unicast DNS servers using server info published via mDNS) and nss-mdns (a libc NSS plugin, providing name resolution via mDNS). Finally there is the D-Bus interface which provides a rich object oriented interface to D-Bus enabled applications.

 Upon startup avahi-daemon interprets its configuration file \fI/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf\f1 and reads XML fragments from \fI/etc/avahi/services/*.service\f1 which may define static DNS-SD services. If you enable \fBpublish-resolv-conf-dns-servers\f1 in \fIavahi-daemon.conf\f1 the file \fI/etc/resolv.conf\f1 will be read, too.
